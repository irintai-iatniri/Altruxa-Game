**Before:**
```javascript

};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const clearAssessment = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('altruxaAssessment');
  setAssessmentScores(null);
  setAssessmentAnswers({});
  setHasCompletedAssessment(false);

### ✅ Fix #3: Notification Overlap
**Time Taken:** 10 minutes

**Before:**
```javascript
// ❌ Notifications could stack
if (changes.length > 0) {
  setStatChanges(changes);
  setTimeout(() => setStatChanges([]), 3000);
}

const navigateToScene = (sceneName) => {
  // No clearing of notifications
  setCurrentScene(sceneName);
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
// ✅ Clear before showing new notifications
setStatChanges([]);  // Clear first!

if (changes.length > 0) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    setStatChanges(changes);
    setTimeout(() => setStatChanges([]), 3000);
  }, 10);
}

const navigateToScene = (sceneName) => {
  setStatChanges([]);  // Clear on navigation!
  setCurrentScene(sceneName);
};

const goBack = () => {
  setStatChanges([]);  // Clear on back!
  // ... rest
};

const goForward = () => {
  setStatChanges([]);  // Clear on forward!
  // ... rest
};
