## Common Patterns

### For Practices/Exercises
```javascript
{
  name: "Practice Name",
  tagline: "Catchy one-liner",
  description: "What and why",
  steps: [/* detailed steps */],
  timeCommitment: "X minutes",
  difficulty: "Easy/Medium/Hard",
  frequency: "Daily/Weekly",
  examples: [/* 2-3 examples */],
  obstacles: [/* 3-5 obstacles */],
  deepening: "How it evolves"
}
```

### For Crisis Resources
```javascript
{
  crisis: "Type of emergency",
  urgency: "🚨 CRITICAL - timeframe",
  resources: [/* phone numbers, websites */],
  immediate: "What to do now",
  ifYouAreInImminentDanger: "Emergency steps",
  afterImmediateCrisis: "Follow-up"
}
```

### For Communication Templates
```javascript
{
  purpose: "What this is for",
  when: "When to use",
  structure: `Template with [PLACEHOLDERS]`,
  variations: [/* alternatives */],
  tips: [/* communication advice */]
}
```

## Example Structures

### Dimensional Analysis Format
```javascript
dimensional_analysis: {
  "0D": "Self/individual impact",
  "1D": "Direct relationship impact",
  "2D": "Community/institutional impact",
  "3D": "Systems/structural impact",
  temporal: "Time dimension analysis",
  intent: "Motivation question"
}
```

### Step Format with Questions
```javascript
{
  step: "Step name",
  detail: "Description",
  questions: [
    "Guiding question 1?",
    "Guiding question 2?"
  ]
}
```

### Troubleshooting Format
```javascript
{
  "Problem statement": {
    response: "Main response",
    check: "Reality check question",
    practice: "Specific practice",
    reframe: "Alternative perspective",
    minimum: "Minimum viable version"
  }
}
```

## Quick Decision Tree

**What type of guide am I writing?**

```
Is it urgent/crisis help? 
├─ YES → Use immediateResources/immediateActions
└─ NO → Continue

Is it teaching a repeatable practice?
├─ YES → Use dailyPractices + examples
└─ NO → Continue

Is it handling specific scenarios?
├─ YES → Use situationalGuidance + templates
└─ NO → Review existing guides for fit
```

## Red Flags to Avoid

🚫 **Avoid These**:
- Long paragraphs (>5 sentences)
- Abstract concepts without examples
- Preaching or moralizing tone
- "You should" language (use "consider" or "try")
- Promises of easy solutions
- Ignoring structural barriers
- Toxic positivity
- Excessive jargon
- Missing troubleshooting
- No concrete next steps

✅ **Aim For These**:
- Short, scannable sections
- Multiple concrete examples
- Compassionate directness
- "Here's what you can do" language
- Honest about difficulty
- Acknowledges constraints
- Realistic hope
- Clear language
- Anticipates obstacles
- Specific actionable steps

## File Structure Pattern

```javascript
const MODULE_NAME = {
  // Header (2-3 properties)
  // Introduction (1 object, 50-150 words)
  // Main Content (1 array, varies by type)
  // Supporting Sections (0-4 sections, as needed)
  // Troubleshooting (1 object, 3-6 issues)
  // Closing (1 object, 150-300 words)
};

export default MODULE_NAME;
```

## Quick Start: Your First Guide

1. Copy PRACTICAL_ACTIONS_TEMPLATE.jsx
2. Rename to your topic
3. Fill in Header + Introduction (10 min)
4. Choose primary structure type (5 min)
5. Write 3 examples (20 min)
6. Add troubleshooting (15 min)
7. Write closing thoughts (10 min)
8. Review checklist (5 min)

**Total time: ~65 minutes for first draft**

Then iterate: add supporting sections, refine examples, get feedback.

**Remember**: Template is a tool, not a constraint. Adapt as needed while keeping core elements consistent.
