## Core Principles

### 1. Practicality Over Philosophy
Every section must lead to concrete action. Theory serves practice, not vice versa.

### 2. Honesty Over Comfort  
Acknowledge real difficulties. No toxic positivity. Tell the truth compassionately.

### 3. Examples Make It Real
Abstract concepts need concrete scenarios. Show, don't just tell.

### 4. Anticipate Obstacles
People will face barriers. Address them proactively with troubleshooting.

### 5. Balance Individual and Systemic
Never reduce systemic problems to individual solutions. Address both levels.

### 6. Sustainable Ethics
Burnout helps no one. Integrate self-care, not just add it at the end.

### 7. Compassion With Courage
Care for people AND challenge systems. Both are essential.

## Integration with Index

All guides export a default constant that gets imported into `index.jsx`:

```javascript
// In your guide file
export default GUIDE_NAME;

// In index.jsx
import GUIDE_NAME from './guide_name.jsx';

const PRACTICAL_ACTIONS = {
  guide_name: GUIDE_NAME,
  // ... other guides
};
```

Key must match the conceptual name (use underscore_case).

## Tips for Success

### Before You Start
1. Read 2-3 existing guides to internalize voice/tone
2. Decide on guide type (crisis/practice/domain)
3. List out 5+ concrete examples before writing
4. Note 5+ obstacles people will face

### While Writing
1. One section at a time - don't try to complete everything at once
2. Examples first, then framework - concrete before abstract
3. Read your work aloud - if it sounds preachy, revise
4. Ask: "Could someone actually DO this?" - if no, add detail

### Before Submitting
1. Run through Quick Pass/Fail checklist
2. Check every example is realistic and specific
3. Verify troubleshooting addresses real obstacles
4. Confirm tone is compassionate not condescending
5. Make sure it ends with core principle

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I deviate from the template?**
A: Yes, if it serves the content. Template is a tool, not a constraint. But keep core elements (header, intro, examples, troubleshooting, closing).

**Q: How long should my guide be?**
A: Varies by type. Crisis guides: shorter and focused. Practice guides: more comprehensive. Use length needed to be useful, no more.

**Q: What if my guide doesn't fit any type?**
A: Review existing guides to see if one is similar. If truly unique, use situationalGuidance as base and adapt as needed. Document your reasoning.

**Q: How many examples is enough?**
A: Minimum 3. More is better for complex topics. Aim for diversity in scenarios and difficulty levels.

**Q: Should I include resources?**
A: If domain-specific resources exist (legal, organizing, support services), absolutely. If not, skip this section.

**Q: How do I handle conflicting advice?**
A: Acknowledge complexity. "In X situation, consider Y. In Z situation, consider W." Provide framework for user to decide.

## Template Philosophy

These templates exist to:
1. **Ensure consistency** - Users know what to expect
2. **Maintain quality** - Standards prevent low-quality guides
3. **Save time** - Don't reinvent structure for each guide
4. **Scale effectively** - Multiple authors can contribute
5. **Stay Altruxan** - Framework integration is systematic

But remember:
- **Content over format** - If template constrains good content, adapt it
- **Flexibility within structure** - Not every guide needs every section
- **User needs first** - Template serves users, not vice versa

---

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Users can take concrete action after reading
- âœ… Obstacles are anticipated and addressed
- âœ… Examples make concepts immediately clear
- âœ… Tone is compassionate without being patronizing
