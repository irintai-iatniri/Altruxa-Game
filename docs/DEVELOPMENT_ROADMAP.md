## Incomplete Code & TODO Items

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. **Disconnected Story Endings** 
**Location:** Lines 1900-1950 (approximate)
**Issue:** Some new story branches don't properly connect to endings
```javascript
// story_3_legal_pathway (line ~1836)
// story_3_recorded_conversation (line ~1844)
// story_4_long_game (line ~1852)
// story_3_public_advocate (line ~1859)
```
**Status:** These endings have `isStoryEnding: true` but no menu return or final reflection
**TODO:**
- [ ] Add "Return to Menu" button to all story endings
- [ ] Add final stat summary to each ending
- [ ] Connect endings to proper conclusion scene
- [ ] Test all story paths lead to complete endings

#### 2. **Missing End-Game Scenarios**
**Location:** Lines 1920-2400
**Issue:** Original "Final Scenarios" (scene1, scene2, etc.) might not connect properly to new branches
**TODO:**
- [ ] Verify all Maya's Journey endings properly transition
- [ ] Update transition text to acknowledge stat-gated paths
- [ ] Consider making final scenarios optional/bonus content

#### 3. **Stat Balance Needs Tuning**
**Location:** Lines 625-755 (new stat-gated choices)
**Issue:** Stat requirements might be too high for first playthrough
```javascript
// Current requirements:
requires: { wisdom: 7 }      // First gated choice
requires: { wisdom: 8, compassion: 6 }
requires: { wisdom: 9 }
requires: { wisdom: 10, empathy: 8 }
requires: { courage: 9, compassion: 8 }
```
**TODO:**
- [ ] Playtest to determine if stats reach these thresholds naturally
- [ ] Consider lowering initial requirements (5-6 range)
- [ ] Add more +2 and +3 stat gain choices earlier in story
- [ ] Create stat gain "cheat sheet" for testing

#### 4. **Assessment Score Conversion Formula**
**Location:** Lines 237-257
**Issue:** Conversion from -10/+10 assessment to 0-10 stats needs validation
```javascript
const initialStats = {
  empathy: Math.max(0, Math.round((normalized.goodEvil + normalized.selfishSelfless) / 2) + 5),
  wisdom: Math.max(0, Math.round((normalized.scrupulousUnscrupulous + normalized.goodEvil) / 2) + 5),
  compassion: Math.max(0, Math.round((normalized.selfishSelfless + normalized.goodEvil) / 2) + 5),
  courage: Math.max(0, Math.round((normalized.couragePrudence + normalized.scrupulousUnscrupulous) / 2) + 5)
};
```
**TODO:**
- [ ] Test edge cases (all negative assessment, all positive)
- [ ] Verify starting stats feel appropriate (currently 0-10 range)
- [ ] Consider adding assessment score display on compass view
- [ ] Document intended stat progression curve

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 5. **Incomplete Journal Integration**
**Location:** Lines 2657-2677 (journal trigger logic)
**Issue:** Journal prompts only trigger every 2 choices, might miss important moments
**TODO:**
- [ ] Add manual journal entry option at any time
- [ ] Create scene-specific journal prompts for major decisions
- [ ] Add journal reflection to final summary/endings
- [ ] Consider journal achievement badges

#### 6. **Stats Display Context-Awareness**
**Location:** Lines 164-185 (StatsDisplay component)
**Issue:** Stats display shows on all scenes, might be distracting during story moments
**TODO:**
- [ ] Add toggle to hide/show stats panel
- [ ] Consider condensed view during story scenes
- [ ] Highlight stats that just changed with glow effect
- [ ] Add tooltip explaining what each stat unlocks

#### 7. **Teaching Scenes Integration**
**Location:** Various `isTeaching: true` scenes
**Issue:** Teaching interludes exist but might not trigger at ideal moments
**TODO:**
- [ ] Review when teaching scenes appear in flow
- [ ] Add CRT teaching for stat-gated moments
- [ ] Create teaching scene about stat growth system
- [ ] Link teaching content to unlocked choices

#### 8. **Navigation History Edge Cases**
**Location:** Lines 62-85 (navigation functions)
**Issue:** Back/forward navigation with modal interrupts (journal) might break
**TODO:**
- [ ] Test navigation after journal entry
- [ ] Prevent navigation history pollution from modal opens
- [ ] Add navigation history size limit (prevent memory bloat)
- [ ] Consider adding "breadcrumb" navigation display

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY

#### 9. **Moral Trajectory Chart Enhancements**
**Location:** Lines 2305-2400 (approximate - MoralTrajectoryChart component)
**Issue:** Chart is good but could show more insights
**TODO:**
- [ ] Add stat growth over time to chart
- [ ] Show locked choices missed due to low stats
- [ ] Compare player path to "optimal" paths
- [ ] Export chart as image

#### 10. **Accessibility Improvements**
**Location:** Throughout component
**TODO:**
- [ ] Add ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all choices
- [ ] Screen reader testing and optimization
- [ ] High contrast mode support
- [ ] Font size controls

---

**TODO:** Test on various mobile devices, add responsive breakpoints

#### Potential Bug #4: State Synchronization
**Description:** Multiple state updates in rapid succession might cause race conditions
**Location:** Lines 2645-2730 (makeChoice function)

### State Management Patterns

**Current Approach:** useState hooks (18 separate state variables)

**Considerations for Refactor:**
- Consider useReducer for complex state (scores, choices, history)
- Context API for deeply nested components (stats display)
- Consider state management library (Zustand, Redux) if expanding significantly

### Data Flow

```
Assessment ‚Üí Scores ‚Üí Stats ‚Üí Story Choices ‚Üí Updated Stats ‚Üí Gated Choices ‚Üí Endings
                                      ‚Üì
                                Journal Entries
                                      ‚Üì
                                Reflection
```

### Critical Functions

1. **submitAssessment()** (Line 215)
   - Processes all assessment answers
   - Normalizes scores to -10/+10
   - Converts to initial character stats
   - Sets up for story

2. **makeChoice()** (Line 2645)
   - Handles ALL player choices
   - Updates stats
   - Tracks story choices
   - Manages journal prompts
   - Navigates to next scene

3. **isChoiceAvailable()** (Line 2761)
   - Validates stat requirements
   - Determines which choices player can see
   - Critical for stat-gating system

### LocalStorage Schema

```javascript
// Current storage keys:
{
  "altruxaAssessment": {
    goodEvil: -10 to +10,
    selfishSelfless: -10 to +10,
    scrupulousUnscrupulous: -10 to +10,
    couragePrudence: -10 to +10
  },
  
  "altruxaJournal": {
    [sceneId]: "entry text",
    ...
  }
}

// Missing storage:
// - Current stats
// - Story progress
// - Unlocked achievements
// - Character class
```

### Performance Considerations

**Current:**
- All scenarios loaded in memory (~3500 lines)
- No code splitting
- No lazy loading

**If Expanding:**
- Consider lazy loading story arcs
- Split assessment/teaching/story into modules
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists (journal view)
