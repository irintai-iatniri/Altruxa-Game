# 🎉 Altruxa Path Game v.0.0.4 - Bug Fix Release

**Release Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Previous Version:** v1.5 (Stats Integration)  
**Status:** ✅ All Critical Bugs Fixed - Ready for Playtesting

---

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### ✅ Fix #1: Incomplete Story Endings (HIGH PRIORITY) 
**Issue:** 6 story endings had empty choices arrays, leaving players stuck with no way to return to menu or view their complete journey.

**Affected Endings:**
- `story_3_legal_pathway` - The Legal Process ending
- `story_3_recorded_conversation` - The CEO's Confession ending
- `story_4_long_game` - The Inside Agent ending
- `story_3_public_advocate` - The Public Advocate ending
- `story_ending_reformer` - The Inside Reformer ending
- `story_ending_clean_exit` - A New Beginning ending

**Fix Applied:**
Added two choices to each ending:
```javascript
choices: [
  { text: "Return to Main Menu", next: "menu", values: {} },
  { text: "View Your Complete Journey", next: "story_ending", values: {} }
]
```

**Lines Changed:** 1842-1888 (6 scene definitions)

**Result:** ✅ All endings now provide proper closure and navigation options

---

### ✅ Fix #2: Assessment Reset Bug (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue:** When retaking the assessment, stat gains from previous story playthrough persisted, resulting in inflated starting stats.

**Reproduction:**
1. Complete assessment (get initial stats 3-7)
2. Play through story gaining stats (+5 to +10)
3. Retake assessment
4. New assessment scores added ON TOP of story gains
5. Result: Starting stats of 15+ (should be 3-7)

**Root Cause:**
`clearAssessment()` function only cleared assessment data, not gameplay progress.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
const clearAssessment = () => {
  localStorage.removeItem('altruxaAssessment');
  setAssessmentScores(null);
  setAssessmentAnswers({});
  setHasCompletedAssessment(false);
  // NEW: Clear gameplay stats and progress when retaking assessment
  setScore({ empathy: 0, wisdom: 0, compassion: 0, courage: 0 });
  setChoices([]);
  setStoryChoices([]);
};
```

**Lines Changed:** 56-65

**Result:** ✅ Retaking assessment now properly resets all game state

---

### ✅ Fix #3: Stat Change Notification Overlap (LOW PRIORITY)
**Issue:** When navigating quickly or making rapid choices, stat change notifications could stack and overlap, creating visual clutter.

**Reproduction:**
1. Make choice that changes stats → Notification appears
2. Quickly click Back button
3. Make different choice → New notification appears
4. Old notification still visible alongside new one

**Root Cause:**
- Notifications persisted for full 3 seconds regardless of navigation
- No clearing mechanism before showing new notifications
- Navigation didn't clear existing notifications

**Fix Applied:**

**Part A - Clear before showing new notifications:**
```javascript
// Clear any previous notifications before showing new ones
setStatChanges([]);

// Show stat changes briefly
if (changes.length > 0) {
  // Small delay to ensure clear happens first
  setTimeout(() => {
    setStatChanges(changes);
    setTimeout(() => setStatChanges([]), 3000);
  }, 10);
}
```

**Part B - Clear on all navigation events:**
```javascript
const navigateToScene = (sceneName, addToHistory = true) => {
  // Clear any visible stat change notifications when navigating
  setStatChanges([]);
  // ... rest of function
};

const goBack = () => {
  if (historyIndex > 0) {
    setStatChanges([]); // Clear notifications when navigating back
    // ... rest of function
  }
};

const goForward = () => {
  if (historyIndex < navigationHistory.length - 1) {
    setStatChanges([]); // Clear notifications when navigating forward
    // ... rest of function
  }
};
```

**Lines Changed:** 
- 67-79 (navigateToScene)
- 81-86 (goBack)
- 88-94 (goForward)  
- 2702-2728 (makeChoice notification logic)

**Result:** ✅ Notifications now clear properly and never overlap
