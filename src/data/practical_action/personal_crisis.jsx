    text: "You're in crisis. Maybe it's been building for months. Maybe it hit today. Maybe you're not sure if it 'counts' as crisis because you're still functioning, still showing up, still alive. Here's the truth: You don't have to be at rock bottom to deserve help. You don't have to prove your suffering is 'bad enough.' Crisis is when your current coping strategies aren't working anymore. Crisis is when you need help and you're reading this.",
    
    altruxanFramework: "Objective morality measures harm reduction. Sufferingâ€”including YOUR sufferingâ€”demands response. When you're drowning, you can't pull others to shore. Self-care isn't selfish; it's strategic. You matter not because you're useful to the movement, but because suffering matters. Period. When we reduce sufferingâ€”including our ownâ€”it is good.",
    
    criticalTruths: [
      "Asking for help is courage, not weakness. The system wants you to believe otherwise.",
      "You don't have to 'earn' the right to care. You're not too privileged, too functional, or too anything to deserve support.",
      "Crisis doesn't mean you failed. Systems are designed to break people. Surviving them requires help.",
      "Professional help isn't weakness. Medication isn't failure. Whatever gets you through is valid.",
      "You can be in crisis AND still show up for othersâ€”but not forever. Sustainability matters.",
      "Some suffering has immediate fixes (food, housing, safety). Some requires long-term support (therapy, medication, systemic change). You need both.",
      "The crisis resources here are stopgaps. They help you survive the moment so you can address root causes."

  closingThoughts: {
    title: "You're Allowed to Need Help",
    text: `The systems we live in are designed to break people. Capitalism demands endless productivity. White supremacy inflicts ongoing trauma. Poverty creates impossible choices. Patriarchy limits how we can be. Ableism tells us we're burdens if we're not 'functional.' Isolation is normalized. Healthcare is gatekept.

You're in crisis not because you failed, but because systems failed you. This doesn't erase your agencyâ€”you still make choices, you still have responsibility for getting help where possible. But shame doesn't belong here.

Some hard truths:

**You're allowed to need help.** Not just when you've 'earned' it by proving you're suffering enough. You need help when you need help. That's the only criterion.

**Asking for help is courage.** Systems want you to believe it's weakness so you suffer alone and invisible. They're lying.

**Professional help isn't giving up.** Therapy isn't failure. Medication isn't failure. Hospitalization isn't failure. Whatever gets you through is valid.

**You can't cope your way out of systemic oppression.** Coping skills help you survive while working for systemic change. Both matter.

**Some suffering is immediate and needs immediate response.** Crisis resources. Emergency care. Safety planning. Use them.

**Some suffering is chronic and needs ongoing support.** Therapy, medication, community, treating root causes. Use those too.

**You don't have to be grateful.** You don't have to perform gratitude for inadequate help. You can accept help AND be angry the help shouldn't be necessary.

**Sometimes all you can do is survive.** That's enough. Surviving systems designed to destroy you is resistance.

**Your survival matters.** Not because of what you contribute. Not because people need you. Because suffering matters and your death would be suffering.

The Altruxan path through personal crisis:

1. Name the suffering. Yours matters.
2. Reduce immediate harm. Use crisis resources. Get safe.
3. Build support networks. Professional, peer, community.
4. Address root causes where possible. Treat trauma. Treat mental health. Change life circumstances if you can.
5. Understand systemic context. You didn't fail. Systems failed.
6. Connect individual healing to collective liberation. Your survival is political act.
7. Rest. You're allowed to rest.

You're reading this because you need help or you're helping someone. Either way: The fact that you're here, seeking resources, trying to figure this outâ€”that's courage. That's the Altruxan path. Seeing suffering and responding to it, even when the suffering is yours.

When we reduce sufferingâ€”including our ownâ€”it is the most good.

You matter. Your pain matters. Your survival matters. Get help. You deserve it.`
