- Medium: Volunteer at shelter, donate to mutual aid

Layer 2: Understaffed department, unrealistic expectations
Layer 3: Company prioritizes profit over worker wellbeing, no union protection
Layer 4: At-will employment, weak labor laws, cultural glorification of overwork
Root: Capitalism extracts maximum value from labor, power imbalance prevents workers from setting boundaries

Altruxan response:
- Immediate: Set one boundary (leave by 6pm twice this week), actually use sick days
- Medium: Talk to coworkers about collective boundaries, document overwork
- Long-term: Support union organizing, advocate for worker protections, build coalition

Key insight: Your burnout isn't personal failureâ€”it's systemic extraction. Individual self-care doesn't fix systemic exploitation, but it keeps you alive to fight for systemic change.

    "I'm doing all these practices but still feel like a hypocrite": {
      response: "Good. That feeling means your conscience is working. The gap between aspiration and reality never fully closesâ€”we're embedded in harmful systems. But ask: Is the gap SHRINKING? Even slowly? If yes, you're on the path. If no, you might be performing ethics rather than practicing them.",
      check: "Are you doing these practices to feel good about yourself, or to actually reduce suffering? Intent matters."
    },
    
    "These practices make me feel hopeless about how much harm there is": {
      response: "Valid. Dimensional seeing includes seeing suffering you were previously protected from by privilege or ignorance. This is uncomfortable but necessary. Two truths: (1) The harm exists whether you see it or not, (2) Seeing it is the first step to addressing it. Hopelessness often means you're trying to solve everything alone. Connect to collective actionâ€”it transforms despair into agency.",
      practice: "When overwhelmed, zoom in. Pick ONE person, ONE issue, ONE action. Do that. Then another. Systems change through accumulated effort."
    },
    
    "I don't have time for all these practices": {
      response: "Then don't do all of them. Pick 1-2 that feel most urgent for your growth. Better to do one practice consistently than five practices performatively. Also: These practices often SAVE time by reducing the cycles of guilt, anxiety, and dissonance that consume energy.",
      minimum: "If you only have 5 minutes a day, do the Dimensional Pause before significant choices. That alone will transform your life over time."

    "My circumstances don't allow me to live Altruxan values": {
      response: "Partly true. Capitalism, oppression, trauma, disability, caregivingâ€”these constrain choices. But: (1) There's often more space than we think, (2) Direction matters more than speed, (3) Self-compassion is part of Altruxa. Do what you can with what you have. That's enough. AND keep working to change circumstances that constrain everyone's capacity for ethical living.",
      reframe: "Altruxa isn't about personal purityâ€”it's about collective liberation. You're not failing if systems limit your choices. You're participating in systemic oppression (as we all are). The question is: What power do you have, and how are you using it?"
    },

    "I tried to live Altruxan values and it backfired/hurt me": {
      response: "Tell me more. Sometimes 'backfire' means 'social consequences for challenging power'â€”that's not backfire, that's the price of resistance. Sometimes it means 'I tried to help and made things worse'â€”that's a learning opportunity about wisdom. Sometimes it means 'I destroyed myself for others'â€”that's not Altruxa, that's martyrdom. Altruxa includes caring for yourself so you can sustain the work. Distinguish between: (1) Discomfort of growth, (2) Consequences of challenging power, (3) Genuine harm to self that isn't sustainable, (4) Lack of wisdom in how you acted.",
      check: "Did you ACT with courage but WITHOUT wisdom? Altruxa requires both. Courage without wisdom is recklessness. Wisdom without courage is complicity."

    title: "The Point of All This",
    text: `These practices aren't about becoming a "good person." They're about building capacity to see suffering, understand its roots, and respond effectively. 

Altruxa is not a destination. It's a direction. You'll never arrive at perfect empathy, wisdom, compassion, courage, and integrity. But you can orient yourself toward them. You can make each day slightly more aligned with reducing suffering.

The practices work through accumulation. One dimensional pause doesn't change much. A thousand dimensional pauses over a year rewires your cognition. One act of courage doesn't transform systems. A sustained campaign of collective courage does.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. Connect with others doing the same. Celebrate small wins. Learn from failures. Rest when needed. Return to the work.

This is how individuals practicing Altruxa become movements transforming systems.

When we do for the other, it is the most good.`
