  subtitle: "Accountability, repair, and living with moral complexity in Altruxan practice",
  
  introduction: {
    text: "You've caused harm. Maybe you know exactly what you did. Maybe you're just realizing. Maybe you've known for years and the weight is crushing. This is where Altruxa meets its hardest test: Can you hold yourself accountable while still believing you're capable of good? Can you repair harm without drowning in shame? Can you be both the person who did that thing and the person who wants to reduce suffering? The Altruxan answer is yes - but it requires brutal honesty, sustained action, and the willingness to sit with discomfort that doesn't resolve cleanly.",
    
    altruxanFramework: "Objective morality measures harm reduction. You caused harm - that's data, not identity. The question isn't 'Am I a good person or bad person?' The question is: 'What am I going to do about the harm I caused?' Altruxa demands accountability AND self-compassion. Guilt is useful - shame is paralyzing. Transform guilt into action.",
    
    criticalTruths: [
      "Causing harm doesn't make you irredeemable. Systems set us up to harm each other - you still made choices within those systems.",
      "Intent doesn't negate impact. 'I didn't mean to hurt you' is true AND you still hurt them. Both are real.",
      "Apologizing is necessary but not sufficient. Amends require action, not just words.",
      "You don't get to decide when you're forgiven. That's up to the person you harmed.",
      "Some harm can't be fully repaired. You live with that. It changes you. That's appropriate.",
      "Accountability is ongoing practice, not one-time event. You don't 'complete' it and move on.",
      "You're allowed to forgive yourself eventually - but only after you've done the work."
    ],
    
    coreQuestion: "When suffering is visible and I caused it, what am I going to do? Not what I'm going to say - what am I going to DO?"

  understandingMoralInjury: {
    definition: "Moral injury happens when we violate our own values, witness violations we can't stop, or participate in systems that cause harm. It's the wound to our sense of who we are - different from trauma, different from guilt. It's soul-level damage.",
    
    howItFeels: [
      "Shame that won't go away no matter what you do",
      "Feeling like a fraud or hypocrite when you speak about values",
      "Cynicism, numbness, detachment - 'nothing matters anyway'",
      "Self-destructive behavior as unconscious self-punishment",
      "Inability to forgive yourself even when others have forgiven you",
      "Replaying the harm over and over, different endings, all futile",
      "Feeling like you don't deserve good things, happiness, love",
      "Avoiding situations that remind you of what you did",
      "Harsh inner voice that never shuts up about your failures",
      "Losing faith in your own judgment - 'I did that, how can I trust myself?'"
    ],
    
    altruxanView: "The Altruxan path doesn't demand perfection. It demands honesty. Moral injury means your conscience is working - you can still recognize harm. The question isn't whether you made mistakes. Everyone does. The question is: What do you do with them?",
    
    differenceMatters: "Guilt = 'I did something bad.' Shame = 'I am bad.' Guilt can be productive - it motivates repair. Shame is paralyzing - it makes you hide, defend, collapse. Your job is to transform shame into accountability. This is hard. It requires separating your actions from your identity while still taking full responsibility."

    title: "You Can Be Both",
    text: `You are both the person who caused harm and the person trying to reduce suffering. This isn't contradiction - it's human complexity.

Altruxa doesn't require perfection. It requires accountability. You've harmed people. You'll probably harm people again, because you're human and humans are imperfect actors in harmful systems. The question isn't whether you've caused harm - you have. The question is what you do about it.

Some things you need to hold:

**Accountability is ongoing.** You don't complete it and graduate. It's daily practice. Every day you choose: Do I acknowledge harm? Do I make amends? Do I change behavior? The answer won't always be yes. Keep practicing.

**Forgiveness is complicated.** You might forgive yourself before they forgive you. They might forgive you before you forgive yourself. Neither of you has to forgive. Forgiveness isn't required for you to do the repair work.

**Change is slow.** You won't become non-harmful overnight. You'll cause less harm over time. Measure in years, not weeks. Celebrate small improvements while staying honest about remaining work.

**Your guilt serves purpose.** Appropriate guilt keeps you accountable. It motivates repair. It prevents repeat harm. But guilt that just makes you suffer without leading to change is useless. Transform it into action.

**You deserve compassion.** From yourself, eventually. Not as erasure - as recognition that you're doing the work. Self-flagellation isn't accountability. It's just more suffering without reduction of harm.

The Altruxan path through moral injury:
1. See the harm clearly
2. Take full responsibility
3. Make concrete amends
4. Change the behavior
5. Live with the complexity
6. Use it to harm less going forward

You can carry the weight of what you've done while still moving toward reducing suffering. The weight doesn't make you immobile - it can make you more careful, more honest, more committed to not causing that harm again.

You're not who you were when you did that thing. You're also not free from having done it. Both are true. Hold both.

When we acknowledge harm and do the work to repair it, we reduce suffering - including the suffering our actions caused.

That's how broken people practice Altruxa.

When we do for the other - especially after we've harmed them - it is the most good.`
