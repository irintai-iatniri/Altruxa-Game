# Altruxa Path Game - Stats Integration Complete! 🎮

## What's New

I've fully integrated the stats system so your character development affects Maya's Journey. Here's everything that was added:

---

## 1. **Assessment → Initial Stats Conversion** ✨

When you complete the moral assessment, your axis scores now automatically convert to starting character stats:

- **Empathy**: Calculated from Good/Evil + Selfless scores
- **Wisdom**: Calculated from Scrupulous + Good scores  
- **Compassion**: Calculated from Selfless + Good scores
- **Courage**: Calculated from Courage/Prudence + Scrupulous scores

Your stats start in the 0-10 range based on your assessment, giving you a personalized starting point!

---

## 2. **Visual Stats Display** 📊

A new persistent stats panel shows your character development:

- **Four stat cards** with icons (❤️ Empathy, 🧠 Wisdom, 🤝 Compassion, ⚡ Courage)
- **Progress bars** showing your growth (scales to max of 15)
- **Current values** prominently displayed
- Visible throughout your journey (except during intro/assessment)

---

## 3. **Real-Time Stat Change Notifications** 🔔

When you make a choice that affects your stats:

- **Floating notifications** appear in the top-right
- Shows **which stat changed** and **by how much** (+1, +2, etc.)
- **Animated slide-in** effects for visual feedback
- Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
- **Multiple stats** can show at once if affected

---

## 4. **Stat-Gated Story Choices** 🔒

Some choices are now only available if you've developed the right character traits:

### New Stat-Required Options:

**In "Day 8: Preparing for Battle" (story_1d):**
- 🔒 "Seek counsel from a trusted mentor" - Requires **Wisdom 7**

**In "Day 9: The Mentor's Wisdom" (story_1e_mentor):**
- 🔒 "Use her network to amplify the story while remaining anonymous" - Requires **Wisdom 8 + Compassion 6**

**In "Three Weeks Later: The Coalition Effect" (story_2_path_f_strategic):**
- 🔒 "Answer but record the conversation" - Requires **Wisdom 9**

**In "One Month Later: The Network's Impact" (story_2_path_g_anonymous_network):**
- 🔒 "Stay embedded and document other issues" - Requires **Wisdom 10 + Empathy 8**
- 🔒 "Reveal yourself and push for broader reforms" - Requires **Courage 9 + Compassion 8**

### Visual Indicators:
- **Locked choices** are grayed out with a 🔒 icon
- Shows **required stats** beneath the choice
- Can't be clicked until requirements are met

---

## 5. **New Story Branches** 🌳

Added several new story paths that branch from the stat-gated choices:

1. **The Mentor Path** (story_1e_mentor) - For wise players who seek guidance
2. **Strategic Coalition** (story_2_path_f_strategic) - Build a team approach
3. **Anonymous Network** (story_2_path_g_anonymous_network) - Stay hidden but effective
4. **The Long Game** (story_4_long_game) - Become an inside agent
5. **Public Advocate** (story_3_public_advocate) - Full transparency path

### New Endings Added:
- **The Inside Reformer** - Accept CEO's ethics role
- **The Inside Agent** - Stay embedded documenting issues
- **The Public Advocate** - Become an industry whistleblower
- **A New Beginning** - Clean exit with integrity

---

## 6. **Enhanced Choice System** ⚙️

All story choices now:
- **Track stat changes** via the `values` property
- **Can have stat requirements** via the `requires` property
- **Show visual feedback** when stats change
- **Filter automatically** based on your current stats

Example choice structure:
```javascript
{
  text: "Seek mentor's guidance",
  next: "story_1e_mentor",
  values: { wisdom: 1, empathy: 1 },  // Stats gained
  requires: { wisdom: 7 }              // Stats needed
}
```

---

## How It Works Together 🎯

1. **Take the Assessment** → Get your starting stats based on your moral profile
2. **Make choices in Maya's story** → Watch your stats grow with each decision
3. **See notifications** → Get instant feedback when stats change
4. **Unlock new options** → High stat values unlock special story paths
5. **Multiple playthroughs** → Different stat builds lead to different endings

---

## Stat Growth Strategy 💡

To unlock the highest-tier options, you'll want to:

- **Build Wisdom**: Choose thoughtful, strategic options over impulsive ones
- **Grow Empathy**: Try to understand all perspectives before acting
- **Increase Compassion**: Prioritize others' wellbeing in your decisions
- **Develop Courage**: Take meaningful risks despite personal cost

The most powerful endings require **balanced development** across multiple stats!

## What's Next? 🚀

Some ideas for future enhancements:

1. **More stat-gated branches** throughout the story
2. **Stat decay** - stats could decrease from bad choices
3. **Stat thresholds** that unlock entirely new storylines
4. **Character classes** based on stat distributions
5. **Achievement system** for specific stat milestones
6. **Comparison** - see how your stats compare to other paths

Let me know if you want to add any of these or have other ideas!

*Remember: Each choice matters. Each stat point opens new possibilities. Each path reveals different dimensions of Altruxan practice.* 🌟
